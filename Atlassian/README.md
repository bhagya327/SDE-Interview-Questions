- Two strings are anagrams if they are permutations of each other. For example, “aaagmnrs” is an anagram of “anagrams”. Given an array of strings, remove each string that is an anagram of an earlier string, then return the remaining array in sorted order.

- Given an array of n points in the plane, and the problem is to find out the closest pair of points in the array.
